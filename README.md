# React-GraphQL-Project
This repository contains the Client.zip which contains all the code and node_modules necessary for the Front-end and the graphql-server.zip which contains all the code and node_modules necessary for the API.
For the Client are being used Typescript and React.
For the API is used GraphQL and for the database I used MongoDBCompass.
