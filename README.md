# React-GraphQL-Project
This repository contains the Client file with all the code necessary for the Front-end and the graphql-server file with all the code necessary for the API.
For the Client I used Typescript and React, for the API I used GraphQL and for the database MongoDBCompass.
You will need to create a database named AVGO in your MongoDBCompass or change this line: const MONGO_DB = "mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/AVGO"; (line 7, index.ts, graphql-server) and give it the name of your database.
