# React-GraphQL-Project
This repository contains the Client.zip which contains all the code and node_modules necessary for the Front-end and the graphql-server.zip which contains all the code and node_modules necessary for the API.
For the Client I used Typescript and React, for the API I used GraphQL and for the database MongoDBCompass.


Avgoustinos Zigos.

Note: Client.zip will be reuploaded soon.
